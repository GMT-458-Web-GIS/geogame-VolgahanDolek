# The Game:
The game has 3  difficulty levels Easy, Medium and Hard.

Each difficulty has 5 questions.

Game will ask where a place is and ask you to guess.

Since it is nearly impossible to pinpoint the location there will be no lives you will gain score based on how close you got to the actual location.

If you have played once there is no point playing the same difficulty again since you might be able to remember where the locations are.

# Used stuff
I have used leaflet and deepseek for this project.
